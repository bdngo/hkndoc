    \section{Being a Candidate}
        Congratulations on being invited to HKN! Candidacy is extended to the top third of students with senior standing and the top fourth of students with junior standing, with standing being determined by units completed. 
        
        \bigbreak

        Being a candidate means that you'll go through the \textbf{\emph{Candidate Semester}}, which is the semester that you are invited to HKN. The Candidate Semester is designed for you to learn about HKN, get involved with the services we offer to the community, and have a bunch of fun meeting people and attending events. This section is dedicated to providing you with all the information you'll need to make the most out of your Candidate Semester!


    \section{Requirements}
        As a candidate, you'll have some requirements to complete in order to initiate as a member at the end of the semester. While this might seem like a LOT of work at first glance, we promise that it's not and is actually super fun! These requirements should really only take about an hour of your time per week of the Candidate Semester.
        
        \bigbreak

        There's a couple of steps for having something count towards the completion of a requirement. Here's what they are:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \href{https://dev-hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/events/}{RSVP to an event on the calendar} corresponding to the type of requirement you're working on.
            \item Attend the event (lol).
            \item At the end of the event, you will either be manually checked off by an officer or there will be attendance/check-in password. This will be given out by the officer(s) hosting the event at the end of the event. Enter this password in the RSVP page of the event to get credit for it.
        \end{enumerate}

        To see your progress towards completing your requirements, check out the \href{https://dev-hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/cand/}{Candidate Portal} on the HKN Dev website. \textbf{The deadline to complete all of your requirements is Root Beer Float Night (RBFN), which takes place in the last week of November.} If you ever find that you are struggling to finish some requirements and are worried that you won't be able to complete some of them, please reach out to the current External Vice President (Omar Yu for Fall '23) and we'll work something out.

        \bigbreak

        Now, let's actually get into the requirements:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Attend Candidate Meeting (CM)}: You've probably already done this if you're reading this.
                \item \textbf{Attend all 3 General Meetings (GMs)}: These are integral to your candidate semester experience and are the most important events to make. If you can't make one of these, let your EVP know immediately.
                \item \textbf{Attend 3 Fun events}: Fun events are exactly what they sound like - fun! There will be an almost seemingly-infinite amount of varied activities for you to take part in and enjoy.
                \item \textbf{Attend 1 Big Fun event}: Big Funs are Funs but bigger. These events span from going to SF, having a puzzle-solving race across campus, participating in large-scale field events, and more.
                \item \textbf{Attend 1 Community event}: Community events are meant for you to hang out with the greater EECS community or the general community at Berkeley. These range from chill make-your-own boba sessions, playing board games, collaborating with other organizations, and more.
                \item \textbf{Attend 1 Service event}: Service is a core pillar of HKN. You'll have the opportunity to help out at our annual EECS Day for prospective high school students, assist the Berkeley Project, make/hand out sandwiches for the homeless, and more.
                \item \textbf{Attend 1 Officer Hangout}: Our officers will be hosting their own hangouts for you to learn more about them and have some fun! \textbf{You must attend a hangout that is hosted by at least one officer who isn't an officer in your committee or your byte.}
                \item \textbf{Complete 1 Officer Challenge}: Officers will periodically be giving challenges out in the \#challenges channel in the candidate Slack. We'll also have some dedicated time during General Meetings for challenges to be given out and taken. \textbf{Your challenge must be issued by an officer who is not your byte.}
                \item \textbf{Complete 3 Bit-Byte Hangouts}: As part of your Candidate Semester, you'll be part of a Bit-Byte group. Hang out with them! More details about Bit-Byte groups can be found in the Bit-Byte section below.
                \item \textbf{Complete your Candidate Project}: As part of your Candidate Semester, you'll be assigned to one of our nine committees. You'll be given a Candidate project to complete, which is all about learning and getting involved in the work your committee does. More details about the this can be found in the Candidate Project section below.
            \end{itemize}
